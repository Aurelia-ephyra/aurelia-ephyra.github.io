# Thyroid health
The thyroid gland produces triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones which are important for all essential functions of the body. Any issues with the thyroid gland can affect the production of these hormones. This gland is located on the front side of our neck. It is a butterfly-shaped gland. It helps with metabolism, breathing, maintaining temperature, heart rate, etc. When your thyroid gland is producing too much or too little hormone then, it causes thyroid gland disorders. However, you can prevent these conditions by avoiding processed foods, eating iron-rich foods, or consuming selenium supplements in the diet. 

Learn more in detail about thyroid health and its common conditions in this chapter. 

## Functions of the Thyroid gland 
- The main function of the thyroid gland is to regulate your metabolism. Other functions include 
- It regulates body temperature and heart rate. 
- It also helps with growth and development in the body as it regulates the pituitary gland to release growth hormones. 
- As it regulates metabolism so it also helps to regulate weight, digestion, and moods. 
- It also controls the menstrual cycle. 

## Common thyroid conditions 
When your thyroid gland produces too much hormone or too few hormones, it leads to several thyroid conditions. The most common are: 
- __Grave’s disease__: Grave’s disease is the most common condition which causes hyperthyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease that makes your immune system attack your thyroid gland. This condition can happen at any age, however, it is more common in people in their 20s and 30s. Risk factors like family history, stress, smoking, or having Epstein-Barr virus infection can lead to Grave’s disease. Common symptoms are - irritability, fatigue, tremors, irregular heart rate, excessive sweating, or difficulty sleeping. While there is no cure for Grave’s disease, you can manage its symptoms with treatment. 
- __Hashimoto’s thyroiditis__: This disease is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is also an autoimmune disease that makes your immune system attack and slowly destroys your thyroid gland. It can happen at any age but is most common in middle-aged women. Some people experience mild symptoms while some have no major symptoms. Common symptoms are - fatigue, depression, constipation, dry skin, or a puffy face. There is no cure for this disease. But with treatment, you can manage your symptoms. 
- __Goiter__: Goiter is a noncancerous condition in which your thyroid gland size increases. The most common cause of this condition is an iodine deficiency in your diet. This condition can happen at any age, worldwide 15.8% of the population has a goiter, and you only develop its symptoms if it is severe. Symptoms include - swelling in your neck, difficulty breathing or swallowing, coughing, or a hoarse voice. You can treat this condition with radioactive iodine therapy or surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. 
- __Thyroid nodules__: This condition happens when nodules grow on or in your thyroid gland. This condition is more common in women than in men.  While most thyroid nodules are not serious and don’t cause symptoms, a small percentage of thyroid nodules can be cancerous. Symptoms include swelling at the base of the neck, shortness of breath,  or difficulty swallowing. Treatment depends on the type of thyroid nodules you have. Treatment involves surgery, radioactive iodine, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. 

## 8 Warning signs of Thyroid imbalance
If you're feeling anxious, tired, bloated, or constipated for no apparent reason, your body may be signaling that your thyroid levels are out of whack. More than 12 million Americans have thyroid disease and are unaware of it. Doral Health & Wellness offers high-quality interdisciplinary medical treatments as well as advanced Endocrinology services. Let us assist you in determining the 'not-so-obvious' signs of thyroid dysfunction.

### Fatigue & Muscle Weakness 
Because hyperthyroidism speeds up your metabolism, you get tired quickly as you burn more calories. Hypothyroidism causes your body to produce fewer thyroid hormones, causing it to slow down. You become sluggish and sluggish, have difficulty concentrating, and become tired more frequently.
Your muscles begin to lose form and power when they are not stimulated by thyroid hormones.
- Aches and pains: When your body slows down due to a lack of fuel, it breaks down fat and muscle tissue, resulting in weakness, soreness, and pain.
- Joint stiffness and pain: Thyroid diseases can cause joint stiffness and pain.
- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome: As your body slows down, fluid accumulates, compressing the nerves in your wrist. Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by numbness, tingling, and weakness in your fingers and wrist.
### Weight Problems
Thyroid hormones influence metabolism and weight. Increased thyroid activity or levels (hyperthyroidism) will increase both your metabolism and appetite. This can result in unexplained weight loss, while a decrease in thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) can significantly slow down your metabolism leading to unexplained weight gain.
### Problems with Menstruation & Pregnancy
Hyperthyroidism speeds up your body's mechanisms, causing your periods to become lighter.
Unlike hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism causes the menstrual cycle to slow down and the bleeding to become heavier.
Thyroid disorders have also been linked to pregnancy complications ranging from preeclampsia to stillbirth, premature delivery, or a low-birth-weight baby, according to research.
### Rapid heartbeats/Palpitations
Your heart beats faster than usual as a sign of high thyroid hormone levels. Palpitations can occur as the heart's pumping activity increases. Thyroid levels that are lower than normal reduce the flexibility of your blood vessels, making it more difficult for your heart to pump blood to all parts of your body, resulting in low blood pressure. If you notice that your heartbeats are irregular, you should have your thyroid health checked.
### Sensitivity To Temperature Changes 
The thyroid gland is in charge of regulating your body's temperature and any changes in your body’s internal thermostat could be signs of thyroid disorder.
Excessive Sweating: Increased thyroid hormones tell your body to burn energy faster, causing it to heat up faster than usual and causing you to sweat more (to cool off).
Sensitivity to Cold: Because of the lower hormonal levels, your metabolism slows and your body has a difficult time heating up. As a result, even in the breezy New York summer, you'll always feel cold.
### Mood Switches and depression
Thyroid hormones are closely linked to your mood, so any sudden changes in your mood could be a sign of thyroid imbalance.
Panic, Anxiety, and Nervousness: When your thyroid gland works harder than usual, the hormones tell your body that it is overworked. This results in hyperactive moods such as nervousness, panic attacks, thoughts of impending doom, and anxiety.
Dejection, Brain Fog, and Depression: When your thyroid levels are low, your nervous system slows down as well. Along with a general sense of sluggishness and lethargy, you may experience mood swings and signs of depression.
### Changes in Bowel Movements 
Thyroid hormone fluctuations can even have an impact on your digestive system.
More frequent bowel movements are associated with hyperthyroidism because your digestive processes are overworked.
Constipation is caused by hypothyroidism, which slows your digestive process. If you haven't had a bowel movement in days, you should consult your doctor.
### Patchy skin, weak nails, and thinning hair
Thyroid hormones control hair and nail growth and maintenance. The extra hormones in your body boost the growth of your hair follicles and nails if you have hyperthyroidism. As the natural life cycle of hair follicles and nails is accelerated, they are unable to get the required nutrients and this leads to brittle, thin, and weak nails and hair.
Thyroid hormones also have an impact on skin quality.
Dry and itchy skin: Hyperthyroidism causes your body to speed up the turnover of skin cells, resulting in itchy and dry patches of skin.
Other signs include skin darkening, rashes, lumps, and reddish spots.
Swelling on the face: Hypothyroidism causes extra fluid to accumulate in your body. This usually manifests as swelling on your face (eyelids, lips, and tongue) as well as your ankles and fingers.

## Prevention tips
Mostly you can prevent hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, iodine deficiency caused by hypothyroidism can be prevented by consuming a diet rich in sodium. You can’t prevent hyperthyroidism which is caused by Grave’s disease, an autoimmune disorder. In rare cases, the thyroid becomes overactive if you eat highly processed food that contains high amounts of iodine. While preventing thyroid disease is not possible but you can prevent the complications by getting an early diagnosis and following your treatment plan.
While you can’t prevent all thyroid conditions but you can take some steps that help you keep your thyroid healthy. Such as: 
- Avoid or limit highly processed foods. 
- Eat enough iron in your diet. 
- Consume selenium-containing food or supplements. 
If your thyroid gland produces too much or too little thyroid hormones it means that you have an overactive or underactive thyroid gland which is caused by several thyroid conditions. While you cannot prevent them, early diagnosis and treatment can help you manage your symptoms well and prevent their complications. 

## Thyroid diseases and old age
Several studies involving people over the age of 65 show that thyroid disease is primarily a disease of the elderly and that it frequently goes undiagnosed. The difficulty in diagnosing thyroid abnormalities in older people is that they can appear very different than they should. While some symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism in older patients are similar to those in younger patients, symptoms of both disorders frequently manifest in older patients in subtle ways, masquerading as diseases of the bowel or heart or a nervous system disorder.
### Thyroid function in old age
Thyroid function is normally tested by evaluating the levels of Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (T3 and T4) levels. TSH levels have been found to rise in older people (70 and up), but this is not always associated with poor health. 
When blood thyroid hormone levels (T3 and T4) are normal but TSH levels are high, an increasing number of older people are diagnosed with a mildly underactive thyroid (subclinical hypothyroidism).
### Thyroid diseases in old age
#### Hyperthyroidism
If there is too much thyroid hormone, as in all hyperthyroid patients, every function of the body tends to speed up. 
- Symptoms: However, whereas younger people with thyroid disorders frequently have multiple symptoms associated with an overactive thyroid (weight loss, palpitations, sweating, nervousness, tremors), older people may only have a few symptoms, such as heart palpitations and chest discomfort when climbing stairs. Others may have tremors and depression but no other symptoms.
- Treatment: Antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine are used to treat hyperthyroidism in older people (just as they are in younger people). Because of the increased risks associated with operations in the elderly, surgery is rarely recommended. While Graves' disease is still a common cause of hyperthyroidism in old age, toxic nodular goiter (either multiple or a single overactive nodule) resulting in hyperthyroidism is more common than in younger people. 

Because of the increased likelihood of co-existing diseases - cardiac, central nervous system, and thyroid - in older patients, the effects of changes in thyroid function on other body systems are closely monitored during treatment for an overactive thyroid.
#### Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is very common in patients over the age of 60, and its prevalence rises steadily with age. Undiagnosed hypothyroidism may affect up to one in every four nursing home patients. 
- Symptoms: Memory loss or a decline in cognitive functioning, which is frequently attributed to aging, maybe the only symptom of hypothyroidism. Weight gain, sleepiness, dry skin, and constipation are symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism, but the absence of these symptoms does not rule out the diagnosis. 
- A doctor's high index of suspicion is often required to make this diagnosis in an elderly patient. A positive family history of thyroid disease, previous treatment for hyperthyroidism, or a history of extensive neck surgery and/or radiotherapy are all indicators of hypothyroidism.
- Treatment: The decision to treat the patient with a new diagnosis of hypothyroidism will be based on a number of factors, including whether the patient is symptomatic or simply has an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. The presence or absence, as well as the severity of thyroid-related symptoms and co-occurring diseases such as coronary artery disease or heart failure, would determine the dosage of thyroid replacement that is given for treatment.
 Older patients with thyroid disorders require extra attention to gradual and careful treatment, as well as lifelong monitoring.

## Thyroid function tests
Thyroid function test is recommended by the doctor when your thyroid hormone is very low or high which is a sign of a thyroid problem. . 

### What is the thyroid function test?
This test is used to tell if your thyroid gland is working properly or not. The thyroid hormone is released by the thyroid gland which is located in the front part of the neck.  This hormone regulates your metabolism, temperature, weight, and energy. 

This test is done by taking blood from a vein in your arm. If your thyroid levels are not in the range then you might suffer from thyroid diseases. 
These are conditions of the thyroid that thyroid blood tests confirm: 
- Hyperthyroidism: This condition happens when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone in the body.  This condition can speed up your metabolism and cause weight loss, rapid heartbeat, insomnia, anxiety, and some other symptoms. 
- Hypothyroidism: This condition happens when the thyroid gland produces too little thyroid hormone in the body. This condition slows down your metabolism and causes weight gain, menstrual irregularity, fatigue, and other symptoms. 
- Other conditions: In case you have either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism you can develop these associated conditions such as:

  - Grave’s disease
   - Thyroid cancer
   - Hashimoto’s disease
   - Thyroiditis
   - Thyroid tumors
   - Goiter
   - Thyroiditis

#### How to prepare for the tests? 
While there is nothing you need to prepare for the test. The only thing when a healthcare professional orders these blood tests, you may need to fast for several hours before the test. Other than that, a nurse/phlebotomist comes and takes a blood sample from your vein. 

#### Procedure and results
The procedure is quite simple for these tests, the doctor first confirms any medications you are taking (a pregnancy or certain medications can influence your test results). 

Then, a healthcare professional takes your blood sample from a vein in your arm. He/she first makes you sit on a chair and ties a band around your upper arm to make the veins swell with blood. Then he/she chooses the appropriate vein, inserts the needle into the vein, squeezes the blood out, and then puts cotton on the puncture site, and applies pressure until the blood stops. 

In these tests, the TSH test and T4 test are done for thyroid function. The TSH test is done to check whether a person has hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. 
The TSH test is used to measure the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone in the blood. The normal test range is 0.4 to 4.0 milli-international units of hormone per liter of blood (miU/L). In case readings are above 4.5 miU/L, then you’re at risk of progressive hypothyroidism. Symptoms such as weight gain, depression, brittle hair, and fingernails, or fatigue. Your doctor recommends you take medications to manage your symptoms. 
The T4 test is to check the overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism). Symptoms such as - anxiety, tremors, diarrhea, or unexplained weight loss are an indication to get T4 levels checked.

Both these T4 and TSH tests were performed on newborn babies to check low-functioning thyroid glands. If left untreated, this condition causes congenital hypothyroidism that can cause developmental disabilities. 

There is a T3 test that is also used when patients have symptoms of  Grave’s disease, an autoimmune condition linked with hyperthyroidism. 

#### Side effects 
While there are no major side effects of thyroid function tests. But there are some side effects you can experience after drawing blood such as:
- Slight bruise
- Soreness at the area where blood is drawn
- Pain around the area and swelling around it. Call the doctor immediately if this happens because it is a sign of infection. 

#### Follow up
In case of your test shows the thyroid gland is overactive, your doctor suggests taking a thyroid uptake test or ultrasound. If your results are normal, your doctor suggests some medication to manage your thyroid activity. They might also order some follow-up tests to check your thyroid functioning to make sure the medication is working. These tests make sure that you don’t have any structural problems with the thyroid gland, thyroid gland activity, or any tumors that cause problems. 

In case the doctor orders an ultrasound if they discover abnormal findings during a physical exam of your neck. If tests are abnormal, then the doctor takes a tissue sample of the thyroid to check whether you have thyroid cancer or not. Understand that, only blood tests are not enough to diagnose thyroid cancer. 

Thyroid function tests are used to check your thyroid hormone levels in case you're having symptoms of thyroid diseases of an overactive or underactive gland. In case your results are abnormal, then the doctor suggests an ultrasound. In case your results come normal, the doctor gives you some medications to regulate your thyroid activity for better thyroid functioning.
